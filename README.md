### Docker Integration
To run the full-stack project on your local system, you have two options:

**Option 1:**
   - Clone the project from GitHub.
   - Run `npm install` in the root folder and inside the frontend folder.
   - Execute `npm run dev` in the root folder to run both frontend and backend concurrently.

**Option 2:**
   - Clone the project from GitHub.
   - In the root folder, run `docker-compose up --build -d`.
   - The frontend and backend will run in your local system without npm install.

### API Documentation
The API documentation for the backend project is available in Postman. You can view the documentation [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/29225438/2s9YXpWzAm). Please refer to this documentation for details on API endpoints and usage.
